By running binary we can see strange symbols at debug info and they actually change every launch

Ok, let's dive into the binary. We can see that that string was changed its from:
>Welcome to Randy's TinyPoker! DebugInfo: AAAA

It adds to each byte of the string (at "AAAA") corresponding byte from received random string:
![Debug](./debug_fixes.png)
It's quite big piece of code, but actually its logic is as simple as this pseudocode:
```python
r = rand()
s = "Welcome to Randy's TinyPoker! DebugInfo: AAAA"
l = s.find('AAAA')

for i in range(5):
    a = r >> (24 - 8 * i)
    s[l+i] = (s[l+i] + a) % 256

```
So it's very easy to see that we can [produce](./randy.py) reverse function and receive our flag:
Ehm, I forgot to save, so we'll be glad to receive PR for fixing this line :)
