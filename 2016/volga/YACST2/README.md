**Algorithm**

1. Send request to the site, get remaining number of captchas.
2. Download captcha using **curl** (don't ask me why!).
3. Send it to the *Google Speech Recognizer* using python module **speech_recognition**
4. Send numbers to the server.
5. Repeat until you receive flag.

[solve.py](./solve.py)

It took 4 hours to solve 3k captchas. But last captcha I had to solve by myself (for sure :).

Flag is:

> VolgaCTF{Sound IS L1ke M@th if A+B=C THEN C-B=A}
